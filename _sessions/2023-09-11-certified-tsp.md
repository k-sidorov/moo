In this session I will go over the integer-programming flow for solving traveling salesman problem instances (utilized, among others, by <i>Concorde</i> TSP solver) and introduce the approach by Applegate et al. for logging the solver steps that lead to the optimal tour. This approach is used to justify an optimal tour on `pla85900`, the largest instance from the TSPLIB collection.
