Constraint Programming is an elegant paradigm in that the expressive modelling and search capabilites enable users to employ powerful reasoning and exploit domain knowledge to solve their problems. However, CP is an exact solving paradigm, and certain problem instances are simply too big to solve with CP. A common method for these types of problems is Local Search, and Constraint-Based Local Search solvers are able to read regular CP models and run them as Local Search. In this MOO session I will introduce CBLS as a concept and highlight the advantages and key challenges of the method.
