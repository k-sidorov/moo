In this session, I will review the MARCO (<strong>Ma</string>pping <strong>R</strong>egions of <strong>Co</strong>nstraints) algorithm for enumerating all MUSes of a given constraint system (i.e., constraint subsets that are <i>minimally</i> infeasible). In particular, MARCO is constraint-agnostic: it requires an oracle that outputs SAT/UNSAT given a constraint set but does not require any further insight into the constraint structure.
