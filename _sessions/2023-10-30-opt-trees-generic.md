Following up from last time, I will explain how the dynamic programming approach of the MurTree algorithm can be generalized to other optimization tasks, such as fairness, F1-score, survival analysis, cost-sensitive classification, and prescriptive policy generation. If time permits, we can look into necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of dynamic programming for optimizing decision trees.
