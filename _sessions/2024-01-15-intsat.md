Conflict-Driven Clause-Learning (CDCL) SAT solvers can automatically solve very large real-world problems. To go beyond, and in particular in order to solve and optimize problems involving linear arithmetic constraints, here we introduce IntSat, a generalization of CDCL to Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Our simple 1400-line C++ prototype IntSat implementation already shows some competitiveness with commercial solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi. Here we describe this new IntSat ILP solving method, show how it can be implemented efficiently, and discuss a large list of possible enhancements and extensions.
