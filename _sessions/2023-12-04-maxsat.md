In this presentation I will go over the history of MaxSAT and explain how the field has developed over time, starting with branch-and-bound/linear search and continuing with the algorithms which are currently widely used in the field: IHS and OLL (a form of core-guided search), some of which you have heard about recently in the presentations by Jeremias Berg and Andre Schidler. I will also go through some of the improvements made to these methods such as core minimization, abstract cores and weight-aware core extraction which have contributed to making MaxSAT solvers a valid option for solving numerous problems.
