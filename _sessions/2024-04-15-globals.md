In this session, I will follow up on the narrative from Emir’s last session and explore how we could use the CP problem structure to guide branching. We will start with a small problem example and explore why the conventional branching cold starts and what it leaves on the table; after that, I hope to discuss how we can do it for specific constraints (such as all-different, cumulative, or path) and how to put these pieces together in a CP solver.
